Smoke Schedule
=============

This is a Wordpress plugin to display a responsive, interactive weekly schedule of radio shows via the shortcode [smoke-schedule].

It works with the API endpoint and custom post type created by the Smoke Shows plugin. Without that plugin running, this one will break.

The schedule tracks the current time with a marker line that scrolls across left to right, and highlights the currently playing show in a bright colour. Shows are clickable, leading to the profile pages generated by Smoke Shows.
